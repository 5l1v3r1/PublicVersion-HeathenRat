This rat works with tcp client and server ! I don't take any responsabilites for misusage of this Remote Access Tool , you're  responsible for your acts ! ! I used some different libraries (for example the Passwords Plugin) and all what I re-used in my code is linked in commentaries ! Simple but powerfull !



Currently in developement , be patient I work alone

EDIT FROM 31-01-2020 22:16

What will be added ? 

* -TODO List
* -Win32API (from the DLL I've created with many samples from microsoft and forums (ex : found a "trick" to lock keyboard)
and Change Wallpaper is a Win32Api Function !
* -If you have any ideas , make a pull request ! I don't promise I might not find a solution but I will try ! 



* - will be updated soon : * - file manager (with letter drive and access to their files) and confirmation after deleting file
                           * - beta Native Functions (change brightness , gamma , delete file with win32 api , lock keyboard ( with a trick ) :) .....
