All my friends are heathens , take it slow 
RBBRat = Stub 
Client = GUI Server

LAST UPDATE 25-01-20 20:55 :

-fixed bugs client not try to reconnect to server after those closes
-added screenlocker
-added screenshot
-added UDP Flood
-added change wallpaper 
-added taskmanager (can kill task actually don't use refresh feature it is broken for now)
-removed garbage dll and codes
-added commentaries to understand
-added src of DDOS plugin + PW plugins (the 2)


NOTE : 
-LET DDOS.dll next to Heathen Rat , it's a plugin to show you how can work a plugin
-I put code of small plugin inside my client (like change wallpaper) and won't move it to build a plugin

TODO List :

-Improve UI == 50%
-File Manager == 90 %
-Funny == 0 %
-More DDOS/Flood Options == 0 %
-More options for builder == 0 %
... == 0 %
