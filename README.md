This rat works with tcp client and server ! I don't take any responsabilites for misusage of this Remote Access Tool , you're  responsible for your acts ! ! I used some different libraries (for example the Passwords Plugin) and all what I re-used in my code is linked in commentaries ! Simple but powerful !( I inspired by src from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWJja8Qp65Y&t and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UytjOcSHje8 )




Currently in developement , be patient I work alone


All my friends are heathens , take it slow 

RBBRat = Stub 

Client = GUI Server

YOU NEED BUNIFU , XANDERUI 





What will be added next time ?

* -download file and execute (computer and memory)
* -use File Manager to edit txt file and download file from victim
* -...

NOTE : Currently developing a derivative of this rat (like console) so the command center will not be often udapte in this version. Also the stub will be nearly the same in Console Rat (will release soon) and HeathenRat. Also searching for a good lib to make passwords stealer after this shitty chrome update.
